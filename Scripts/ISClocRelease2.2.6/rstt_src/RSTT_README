RSTT-enabled ISC location algorithm

The Regional Seismic Travel Time (RSTT) software package has been developed
by the US DoE Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories,
and it provides regional Pg, Lg, Pn and Sn travel time predictions through a
3D velocity model (also part of the RSTT package). See further details in

In order to use the iscloc RSTT functionality, download the latest version of
the RSTT package from the website 
    http://www.sandia.gov/rstt

RSTT environment variables (required)

    Create the environment variable SLBMROOT pointing to the directory where
    RSTT is installed. For instance:
        export SLBMROOT=/export/home/istvan/SLBM_Root.3.0.2.Linux

    Add {SLBMROOT}/lib to your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH (on a Mac: $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH)
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$SLBMROOT/lib
        
Building the RSTT package

    The RSTT-enabled iscloc calls RSTT functions through the C interface 
    library. Therefore, you only need to compile the main C++ and the C 
    interface libraries.

    On MacOS X you can use SLBM as is, no compilation is required.
    On a linux/unix machine execute the commands:
        make clean_objs
        make geotess
        make cc
        make c

Building the RSTT-enabled ISC locator

    Edit the Makefile in the rstt_src directory to set the ISCPATH variable 
    to the directory where the iscloc source files are found. For instance:
        ISCPATH = /export/home/istvan/ISClocRelease2.2.4/src
    
    To compile the RSTT-enabled iscloc, use the Makefile in the rstt_src 
    directory. Please read also the notes in the INSTALL file.

    Note that at the moment multicore-processing is not enabled with RSTT as
    RSTT is not thread-safe.

RSTT-specific configuration parameters

    There are two RSTT-specific configuration parameters in the config.txt file,
        rstt_model - the pathname for the RSTT model 
        use_RSTT_PgLg - enable/disable the use of RSTT Pg/Lg TT predictions.
    use_RSTT_PgLg and rstt_model can also be given in the instruction line.   

    The RSTT crustal phase travel-time predictions and their partial 
    derivatives are less reliable than the mantle phase (Pn/Sn) predictions. 
    Hence, for the moment the RSTT crustal phase predictions are turned off by 
    default. You can override this by setting use_RSTT_PgLg=1 either in the 
    config.txt file or you can provide it as a command line argument.
