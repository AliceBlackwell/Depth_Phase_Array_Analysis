ISCLOC README

iscloc is the open source code of the ISC location algorithm; it is provided
as is. The tar file contains the source code, the data files used by the 
locator, documentation and examples.

The installation instructions are found in the INSTALL file.
The iscloc code was successfully compiled on linux boxes (Suse, Redhat and 
Ubuntu), as well as under Mac OS 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9. No attempts were made to
compile it under MS Windows.

The iscloc documentation is found in the doc directory, the
source code is found in the src directory.

The rstt_src directory contains the RSTT-enabled version of the ISC locator.

The etc directory tree contains the data files iscloc reads.

The isf directory contains examples for ISF input and output.
Note that because of the random number generation processes in the 
Neighbourhood Algorithm you may expect small variations in the output results, 
especially when multicore processing is enabled.

The utilities directory contains a Perl script that plots the misfits
of the trial hypocentres in the Neighbourhood Algorithm. The script
reads the file created by iscloc when the command line instruction
    write_gridsearch_results=1
is given.
