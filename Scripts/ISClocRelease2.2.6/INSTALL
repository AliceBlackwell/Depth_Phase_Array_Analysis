Dependencies
============

LAPACK and LBLAS (required)
    MacOS X 10.6 and later 
        lapack and lblas are part of MacOS X Accelerate framework
    linux/unix 
        install the corresponding rpm or download it from 
            www.netlib.org/lapack

PostgreSQL client (optional database interface)
    MacOS X 10.6 - 10.8 
        part of MacOS X
    MacOS X 10.9  
        the postgresql client was removed from MacOS X 10.9, but the libraries
        are still there. 
    linux/unix 
        install the PostgreSQL client (don't forget the libpq-fe.h file!) 
    
Grand Central Dispatch (optional multicore processing)
    MacOS X 10.6 and later 
        part of MacOS X
    linux/unix (tested on Ubuntu) 
        install clang and llvm (see llvm.org).
        install libBlocksRuntime, libkqueue, libpthread_workqueue and libdispatch
            see http://mark.heily.com/project/libblocksruntime

RSTT (optional TT predictions for Pn/Sn and Pg/Lg from a global RSTT model)
    download the latest version of the RSTT package from  
        http://www.sandia.gov/rstt
    MacOS X 10.6 and later 
        no compilation is required.
    linux/unix
        make clean_objs
        make geotess
        make cc
        make c
    
Environment variables
=====================

QETC - Directory pathname for data files. If not exists, defaults to current 
       working directory.
PGHOSTADDR, PGPORT, PGDATABASE, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD - Postgres specific.
SLBMROOT - Directory pathname for the RSTT package.


Single-core processing
======================

Linux/unix
----------

Edit the Makefile 

   Set the LAPACK variable to the directory path of the lapack library. 
   Set the IPGSQL variable to the directory path of the libpq-fe.h include file.

Compile with database interface

   If you are going to use a database interface, compile the code with

   make serial_db

   Note that this is the default make behaviour.

Compile without using a database interface

   If you do not have a database following the ISC schema installed in your 
   computer, compile the code by disabling the database interface:

   make serial_nodb

   In this case you will only be able to use ISF input files.

Read the iscloc documentation.

MacOS X
-------

Compile with database interface

   Edit the Makefile 

   Mac OS X 10.6 - 10.8:
       Comment out the line 
       IPGSQL = -I../postgresql_include
   Mac OS X 10.9:
       Include the line 
       IPGSQL = -I../postgresql_include

   If you are going to use a database interface, compile the code with

   make serial_db

   Note that this is the default make behaviour.

Compile without using a database interface

   If you do not have a database following the ISC schema installed in your 
   computer, compile the code by disabling the database interface:

   make serial_nodb

   In this case you will only be able to use ISF input files.

Read the iscloc documentation.


Multi-core processing
=====================

The ISC locator can take advantage of multicore processors using
Apple's Grand Central Dispatch technology. Since Grand Central
Dispatch is open source, with a little effort you can install it on
linux/unix machines, too.

If enabled, concurrent processing is used to
    identify phases in a reading;
    evaluate trial hypocentres in the NA search;
    calculate travel-time residuals;
    invert individual blocks of the block-diagonal data covariance matrix;
    project the data set into the eigensystem.

On a MacBookPro with a quadcore i7, iscloc runs about three times
faster than just using a single processor. On the other hand, you'd
better have at least 2GB of memory.

Linux/unix
----------

Edit the Makefile 

   Set the LAPACK variable to the directory path of the lapack library. 
   Set the IPGSQL variable to the directory path of the libpq-fe.h include file.

Compile with database interface

   If you are going to use a database interface, compile the code with

   make parallel_db

Compile without using a database interface

   If you do not have a database following the ISC schema installed in your 
   computer, compile the code by disabling the database interface:

   make parallel_nodb

   In this case you will only be able to use ISF input files.

Read the iscloc documentation.

Mac OS X

   Edit the Makefile 

   Mac OS X 10.6 - 10.8:
       Comment out the line 
       IPGSQL = -I../postgresql_include
   Mac OS X 10.9:
       Include the line 
       IPGSQL = -I../postgresql_include

   If you are going to use a database interface, compile the code with

   make parallel_db
